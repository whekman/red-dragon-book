### 3.5

A string of length N has how many

a) prefixes

N + 1

Namely, the empty string plus all proper prefixes.

b) suffixes

N + 1

Namely, the empty string plus all proper suffixes.

c) substrings

We have the empty string. Then for substrings length n we have N-n+1 options. So we get 1 + N + (N-1) + (N-2) ... + 1 which amounts to 1 + (N * (N - 1))/2 (Gauss).

d) Proper pre/suf-fixes

N

Same as a (a) and (b) but now without the empty string.

e) Sub-sequences

So now you get into some nasty combinatorics. Here it seems like you have for each character out of N an option to pick it for you sub-sequence. You can pick your first character in N ways, your second in N - 1, etc. So for length 1 sub-sequences you have N options, for length 2: N * (N - 1), in other words for length n: N!/(N-n+1)! options. So in total you have the sum over n = 0 to n = N which cant be simplified as far as I know.
