### 3.2

What are the conventions of use of blanks in (a) Pascal, (b) C, (c) Fortran 77, (d) Ada and (e) Lisp?

In general, it turns out we can distinguish "free-form languages" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-form_language) eg C and its descendants featuring brackets or begin-end constructs to delineate code-blocks, and "off-side rule languages" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule) eg Python where indentation is meaningful and used instead. Furthermore, some languages are meant to be meaningful when ignoring white-space (outside of string literals) eg Fortran while in most free-from langauges any white-space is interpreted as white-space ie a space or space line-break carry the same meaning and is used to seperate tokens eg to distinguish >> from > >. Note, the ignorance of white-space in Fortran had the advantage of allowing users to eg use white-space in identifiers eg AVG X and furthermore meant that programs could be written in a terse manner --- note the language was developed in/before the punch card era.

a) Pascal is a free-form language derived from ALGOL wherein whitespace only use is to separate lexemes (http://wiki.freepascal.org/Punctuation_and_Indentation ) "Since Pascal ignores end-of-lines and spaces, ...".

b) C is also a free-form language derived from ALGOL wherein whitespace only use is to separate lexemes  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12293205/c-is-a-white-space-independent-language-exception-to-the-rule ).

c) In Fortran whitespace is notoriously ignored anywhere except in string literals, this asks a lot from the compiler --- Fortran is taken as an example on this somewhere in the Red Dragon Book [REF].

d) Ada is said to be based on Pascal, from that I assume it has the same handling of white-space as Pascal. Note, the language has a double dash to denote comments (very nice) which stop at the end-of-line (!).

e) Lisp is a free-form language with "fully paranthesized prefix notation" and was originally specified in 1958(!). The source code is made up out of lists (!) -- how weird is that! White-space is used to separate lexemes eg (+ 2 2) is valid Lisp but (+22), the amount of white-space used to do so does not matter. It needs at least one space between atoms (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Whitespace-in-Lists.html ).
