### 3.2

What are the conventions of use of blanks in (a) Pascal, (b) C, (c) FORTRAN 77, (d) Ada and (e) Lisp?

a) In Pascal whitespace sensitive gets stripped out (http://wiki.freepascal.org/Punctuation_and_Indentation ) "Since Pascal ignores end-of-lines and spaces, ...".

b) In C, hard to find --- best I could find (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12293205/c-is-a-white-space-independent-language-exception-to-the-rule ), its complex and in some cases spaces carry meaning/do matter >> vs > >.

c) In FORTRAN whitespace notiously get stripped out --- is written somewhere in the book itself [REF].

d) In Ada, seems like white-space gets stripped out (based on https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Style_Guide/Source_Code_Presentation ). Its only there for readability.

e) In Lisp whitespace definitely matters eg (+ 2 2) is ok but (+22) is not ok. It needs at least one space between atoms (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Whitespace-in-Lists.html )
