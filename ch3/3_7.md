Write regular definitions for the following languages.

a) Strings of letters containing five vowels in orders

If we think of the DFA, it has states `start, a, ae, aei, aeio, aeiou, final, stuck` where the name of the state indicates the vowels already encountered. We go from state A to B if we see the character which makes A into B. We stay in state A if we see a non-vowel or the last accepted vowel. We go into the non-final stuck state if we see any vowel we have already seen, and we stay stuck there.

`start -a-> a (^v|a) -e-> ae (^v|e) -i-> aei (^v|i) -o-> aeio (^v|o) -u-> aeiou (^v|u)`

Funnily enough in the associated regular definition we do not have to specify the "transitions" to the stuck state. This seems like something implicit in the use of a regular definition: if we cant parse the string we reject it. Whereas in a DFA we need to explicitly reject the string. We could think of DFAs with a similar quality where transitions to the stuck state are implicit.

```
v -> vowels
nv -> non-vowels
ordered_vowels -> nv*a(nv|a)*e(nv|e)*i(nv|i)*o(nv|o)*u(nv|u)*
```

b) Strings of letters in which the letters are in ascending lexicographic order.

`a* b* c* ... z*`

c) C-style comments with an optional quoted comment ending inside.

We can do
```
start -> \*
end -> \*
quoted -> "any*"
any -> any character
ordinary -> any character not a * or a "
c-comment -> start (ordinary* quoted*)* end
```

In a regex that would be

`\/ \* ( [^*"]* | ".*" )* \* \/`

Start-symbol, zero or more non-star-non-quote characters or any quoted strings, end-symbol.

d) Strings of digits with no repeated digits.

Let us interpret this as strings over eg 012 like 0201, as opposed to no repetitions at all as in eg 102. The latter would be a combinatorics problem, not that interesting to do using a regular definition.

Here it helps to start out with only three digits eg 0, 1 and 2, to get the gist of it - the solution for all the digits turns out to be practically impossible to do by hand!

Consider the following NFA with states start S, last seen digits 0, 1, 2, a final state F and an illegal state I with transitions:

| s | 0 | 1 | 2 | e |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | 0 | 1 | 2 | F |
| 0 | I | 0 | 0 | F |
| 1 | 1 | I | 1 | F |
| 2 | 2 | 2 | I | F |
| F | I | I | I | F |
| I | I | I | I | I |

Legend: Top rows are input characters, left columns are begin states, entries are states reaced from the begin state after reading the associated input character. The e character is the no-character option.

Claim: This non-deterministic finite automata would end up in the final state if the input string used has no repeated digits.

To find our regular definition, let us focus only on the pathways that lead to the final state and rewrite the automata as a so-called expression automata.

| s | 0 | 1 | 2 | e |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | 0 | 1 | 2 | F |
| 0 | I | 0 | 0 | F |
| 1 | 1 | I | 1 | F |
| 2 | 2 | 2 | I | F |

Let us do without the 0 state and encorporate its use in the regular expression of the associated transition. Note, this method of removing states is apparently known as the method of Brzozowski and McCluskey.

|old|new|expr|
|---|---|---|
| S | f | 0?
| S | 1 | 0?1
| S | 2 | 0?2
| 1 | f | 0?
| 1 | 1 | (01)*
| 1 | 2 | 0?2
| 2 | f | 0?
| 2 | 2 | (02)*
| 2 | 1 | 0?1

Now let us remove state 2:

|old|new|expr|
|---|---|---|
| S | f | 0?2(02)*0?
| S | 1 | 0?1 or 0?2(02)*0?1
| 1 | f | 0? or 0?2(02)*0?
| 1 | 1 | (01)* or (0?(02)*0?1)\*

Now we just have to remove state 1.

For fun, I implemented the graph re-writing algorithm by studying how one does oneself. Using this implementation I got as the very plausible outcome

S -> f = (0?2(02)\*0?1|0?1)(0?2(02)\*0?1|01)\*(0?2(02)\*0?|0?)|0?2(02)\*0?|0?

For further details please have a look at the Jupyter notebook 'nfa-to-regex.ipynb'.

The core of the algorithm is the part where you bypass/eliminate a state. It took a day or two to come up with the idea, it was a nice puzzle. It turns out that this method is known as the state elimination method or the Méthode de Brzozowski et McCluskey ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9thode_de_Brzozowski_et_McCluskey ). The rest is re-phrasing regexes eg using the question mark which turns out to be quite non-trivial aswell. The state elimination method, implemented in Python:

```python

def glue(els):
    return '|'.join(els)

def encaps(s):
    return '(' + s + ')'

def unglue(s):
    return s.split('|')

def simplify(graph, bp):
    """ Simplify a graph by eliminating the bypassable state bp. 
    
    Aka Méthode de Brzozowski et McCluskey
    """

    starts = [src for (src, dst) in graph if dst == bp and src != dst]
    ends = [dst for (src, dst) in graph if src == bp  and src != dst]
    cycles = [move for (src,dst), move in graph.items() if src == dst == bp]

    if cycles:
    	# 1->1: ['01','21'] : (01|21)*
        cycling_move = encaps(glue(cycles)) + '*'
    else:
        cycling_move = ''

    new_graph = {}

    for src in starts:
        for dst in ends:

            move_in = graph[(src,bp)]
            move_out = graph[(bp,dst)]
            
            if '|' in move_in:
                move_in = encaps(move_in)
            
            if '|' in move_out:
                move_out = encaps(move_out)
                       
            move_through = move_in + cycling_move + move_out

            new_graph[(src,dst)] = move_through

    for (src, dst), move in graph.items():

        if (src is not bp) and (dst is not bp):

            k = (src,dst)

            if k in new_graph:
                new_graph[k] += '|' + graph[k]
            else:
                new_graph[(src,dst)] = move
    
    return new_graph

graph = {
    ('S','F'):'_',
    ('S','0'):'0',
    ('S','1'):'1',
    ('S','2'):'2',
    ('0','1'):'1',
    ('0','2'):'2',
    ('0','F'):'_',
    ('1','2'):'2',
    ('1','0'):'0',
    ('1','F'):'_',
    ('2','1'):'1',
    ('2','0'):'0',
    ('2','F'):'_',
}

graph = simplify(graph, '0')

#->

{('1', '1'): '01',
 ('1', '2'): '02|2',
 ('1', 'F'): '0_|_',
 ('2', '1'): '01|1',
 ('2', '2'): '02',
 ('2', 'F'): '0_|_',
 ('S', '1'): '01|1',
 ('S', '2'): '02|2',
 ('S', 'F'): '0_|_'}

```

e) Strings of digits with at most one repeated digit.

Here one use the same method as was used in exercise (d). Here it helps to start out with only two digits eg 0 and 1, to get the gist of it - the solution for all the digits turns out to be practically impossible to do by hand!
