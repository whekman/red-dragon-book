### 3.1

What is the input alphabet of (a) Pascal, (b) C, (c) FORTRAN 77, (d) Ada and (e) Lisp?

a) Pascal --- case non-sensitive!:
    + [a-zA-Z] --- alphabet (upper and lowercase)
    + [0-9] --- digits
    + + - * / = % --- arithmetic
    + & | ! ~ --- bitwise ops
    + ( ) --- op precedence, function defs/calls, collections?
    + < > --- relational, bitwise shift
    + : --- assignment in :=
    + ; --- line-ending, parameter definitions
    + { } --- comments
    + single quotes --- string literals
    + . --- declaring ranges via ..., access to type attributes
    + [ ] --- arrays, type definition in array[type], indexing
    + ^ --- pointers
    + @ --- memory address
    # $ --- hex prefix eg $24 -> 36
    + _ --- can be used in some dialects in identifiers
    + space, tab, form feed, newline?

b) C (ref http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter2/alphabet_of_c.html): 96 characters

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
! " # % & ' ( ) * + , - . /
: ; < = > ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~
space, horizontal and vertical tab
form feed, newline

c) FORTRAN 77 (ref https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/805-4939/6j4m0vn6h/index.html):

+ Space --- Ignored in statements, except as part of a character constant  
+ Tab --- Establish the line as a tab-format source line
+ = --- Assignment  
+ + --- add, unary operator  
+ - --- subtract, unary operator  
+ \* --- Multiply, alternate returns, comments, exponentiation, stdin, stdout, list-directed I/O
+ / --- divide, delimit data, labeled commons, structures, end-of-record
+ ( ) --- enclose expressions, complex constants, equivalence, parameter, or implicit groups, formats, argument lists, subscripts  
+ ,  --- separator for data, expressions, complex constants, equivalence groups, formats, argument lists, subscripts  
+ . --- period, radix point, delimiter for logical constants and operators, record fields 
+ ' --- quoted character literals  
+ " --- quoted character literals, octal constants
+ $ --- delimit namelist input, edit descriptor, directives
+ ! --- exclamation, comments
+ : --- colon, array declarators, substrings, edit descriptor
+ % --- percent sign, special functions: %REF, %VAL, %LOC
+ & --- ampersand, continuation, alternate return, delimit namelist input; use in column 1 establishes the line as a tab-format source line
+ ? --- question mark, request names in namelist group
+ \ --- backslash, escape character
+ < > --- enclose variable expressions in formats

d) Ada (ref: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming/Lexical_elements)
+ [a-zA-Z]
+ [0-9]
+ Special characters: &    '    (    )    *    +    ,    -    .    /    :    ;    <    =    > _

e) Lisp (seems pretty limited, relatively hard to find info on):

+ [a-zA-Z]
+ [0-9]
+ ; --- comments
+ single quote --- quoting lists?
+ double quote --- string literals
+ ( ) --- list declaration
+ + - * / --- arithmetic
+ space --- important syntactic/semantic element eg in (+ 2 2)
