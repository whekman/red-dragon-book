### 3.6

Describe the following langauges:

In general they are languages over the binary alphabet, so all "sentences" in the languages are binary strings.

a) 0(0|1)\*0

Binary strings starting and ending with a zero.

b) ((epsilon|0)1\*))\*

Concatination of zero or more groups of zero or more 1's optionally prefixed with a leading zero.

c) (0|1)\*0(0|1)(0|1)

Binary strings ending on 000 to 011.

d) 0\*10\*10\*10\*

Binary strings with three ones in it.

e) (00|11)\*((01|10)(00|11)\*(01|10)(00|11)\*)\*

What can I say. Binary strings starting with two equal bits, followed by zero or more repitions of a sequence of zero to two two odd-parity bit-pairs followed by zero or more even-parity bit-pairs.
