### 3.4

Write a program for the function `nextchar()` of Section 3.4 using the buffering scheme using sentine.s described in Section 3.2.

I found this a rather odd way to do things, mainly because upon buffering the first half upon reaching the end of the second half we get the input stream in an un-intuitive order: next (EOF) previous (EOF). This means that our lexeme could wrap around in the owin...(EOF)...foll(EOF) way which makes finding the lexeme using a begin and forward index non-trivial. For example, if our begin pointer is the index of the "f" in "follo", and forward is the index of "n" in "owin" then in eg Python we cant simply do buffer[begin:forward] to get out lexeme since begin > forward. We would instead, in this particular case, have to do buffer[begin:] + buffer[:forward]...

That aside, I've come up with the following Python implementation, featuring globals (never resorted to using those thus far...) which produces the following example:

```
STREAM :=     E = M * C ** 2 |
EOF := |
FORWARDP: ^, BEGINP: V

   V
B:     |E = |
   ^
   V
B:     |E = |
    ^
   V
B:     |E = |
     ^
   V
B:     |E = |
      ^
reload 2nd half
remaining stream: C ** 2 |
   V
B:     |M * |
        ^
   V
B:     |M * |
         ^
   V
B:     |M * |
          ^
   V
B:     |M * |
           ^
reload 1st half
remaining stream:  2 |
   V
B: C **|M * |
   ^
   V
B: C **|M * |
    ^
   V
B: C **|M * |
     ^
   V
B: C **|M * |
      ^
reload 2nd half
remaining stream: 
   V
B: C **| 2 ||
        ^
   V
B: C **| 2 ||
         ^
   V
B: C **| 2 ||
          ^
EOF
```

Code, see also 3_4.py:

```python

N = 4

EOFC = '|'

stream = "    E = M * C ** 2 " + EOFC

print("STREAM :=", stream)
print("EOF :=", EOFC)
print("FORWARDP: ^, BEGINP: V")
print()

M = len(stream)

BUFFER = ""

def add_eof_if_necessary(buff, N):
	EOFC = '#'
	if len(buff) < N:
		buff += EOFC
	return buff

BUFFER = BUFFER + stream[:N] + EOFC
stream = stream[N:]

BUFFER = BUFFER + stream[:N] + EOFC
stream = stream[N:]

BEGINP = 0
FORWARDP = 0

def nextchar():
	global FORWARDP
	global BUFFER
	global stream


	FORWARDP += 1
	FORWARDC = BUFFER[FORWARDP]

	end_1st_half = (N + 1) - 1
	end_2nd_half = 2 * (N + 1) - 1

	halt = False

	if FORWARDC is EOFC:

		if FORWARDP is end_1st_half:
			# buffer 2nd half
			print('reload 2nd half')
			BUFFER = BUFFER[:N+1]
			BUFFER = BUFFER + stream[:N] + EOFC
			stream = stream[N:]

			print('remaining stream:', stream)
			# move forward
			FORWARDP += 1
		elif FORWARDP is end_2nd_half:
			# buffer 1st half
			print('reload 1st half')
			BUFFER = BUFFER[N+1:]
			BUFFER = stream[:N] + EOFC + BUFFER
			stream = stream[N:]
			print('remaining stream:', stream)

			# move forward to beginning of 1st half
			FORWARDP = 0

		else:
			print('EOF')
			# actual end of file.
			halt = True

	# halt?
	return halt

def current_lexeme():
	return BUFFER[BEGINP:FORWARDP]

for i in range(32):
	print("  ", " "*BEGINP + 'V')	
	print("B:", BUFFER)
	print("  ", " "*FORWARDP + '^')	
	halt = nextchar()
	if halt:
		break
