### 2.1

Consider the context-free grammar:

S -> S S + | S S * | a

1. Show how the string `aa+a*` can be generated by this grammar.

Well,

S -> SS* -> SS+S* -> aa+a*

2. Construct a parse tree for this string.

```
S
|
+-- S
|   +-- S - a
|   +-- S - a
|   +-- +
+-- S - a
+-- *
```

3. What language does this grammar generate? Justify your answer.

Postfix expressions of addition/multiplication of 'a'.
